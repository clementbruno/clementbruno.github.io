# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there!

My name is Clement, I am a French Software Engineer currently living in Germany. I love to build stuff and solve problems with code.

My primary focus is fullstack web development which is what I currently do for a living.

My favourite programming language is Ruby and I primarily work with Rails.

On this blog I will share some of the things I find interesting.
