# üëã Hey

My name is Clement, I am a French Software Engineer currently living in Germany. I love to code and build fun stuff.<br />

My primary focus is fullstack web development which is what I currently do for a living. In addition to that I am also very much interested in AI, cybersecurity and video games.

My favourite programming language is ‚ù§Ô∏è Ruby ‚ù§Ô∏è<br />

On this blog I will share some of the things I find interesting and some tips I've gathered along the way.
